Predicting fetal age accurately is critical in prenatal care for tracking development, planning checkups, and reducing complications. This app allows users to input 8 clinical measurements — such as Biparietal Diameter (BPD), Femur Length (FFL), and Estimated Fetal Weight (EFW) — and receive an instant prediction of the gestational age in days.

Behind the scenes, a trained Random Forest Regressor processes the inputs and generates a robust prediction. The interface is simple, responsive, and accessible via Streamlit Cloud.
